# **`DrumScript`: Glossary of Terms**

# **Python Libraries**
## [`Librosa`](#librosa)
<!--## **[`librosa`](https://github.com/librosa/librosa)**-->
> **Python library**
   - [`librosa`](https://librosa.org/doc/latest/advanced.html) is a popular open-source Python library for **audio and music analysis**. It is a **powerful toolkit** that helps you **process, analyse**, and understand **sound**.
   - `librosa` provides a wide **range of Python functions** for common tasks in **music information retrieval (MIR)** and **audio processing**, such as:
     - **Loading audio files:** Reading various audio formats (`.wav`, `.MP3`, etc.) into a format Python can easily work with.
     - **Feature extraction:** Converting raw audio into meaningful numerical descriptions (features) that machine learning models can understand, like **MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)**, **spectral centroid**, **rhythm features**, etc.
     - **Time-frequency analysis**: Analysing how the **frequency content of sound** changes over time (e.g., creating **spectrograms**).
     - **Beat and tempo detection:** Identifying the pulse or speed of music.
     - **Pitch tracking:** Estimating the **fundamental frequency** of a **sound**.
     - **Onset detection:** Finding the **precise moments where sounds begin** (like a *snare hit*).

  In `DrumScript`, `librosa` is crucial because it's the underlying library that `audio_loader.py`, `feature_extractor.py`, and `onset_detector.py` use to actually perform the **low-level audio processing** and extract the characteristics of your **drum sound** and **audio recordings**
<!--## **[`MuseScore`](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore)**-->
## [`MuseScore`](#musescore)
   - [`MuseScore`](https://musescore.org/) [source code here](https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore) is a popular, free, and open-source **music notation software**. It provides a comprehensive environment for **creating, editing, printing**, and **playing back sheet music**.
   - `MuseScore` offers a wide range of features for **composing and arranging music**, such as:
     - **Intuitive score entry:** Easily add notes, rests, and other musical elements using a mouse, keyboard, or MIDI input.
     - **Extensive musical symbols:** Supports a vast library of notation symbols, including dynamics, articulations, slurs, tuplets, and complex rhythmic figures.
     - **Playback capabilities:** Hear your compositions with built-in sounds, allowing for immediate feedback on your arrangements.
     - **Layout and formatting:** Professional-quality typesetting and customizable layout options for print and digital distribution.
     - **Import/Export options:** Supports various file formats, including **MusicXML**, MIDI, PDF, and audio formats.

  In `DrumScript`, `MuseScore` is crucial because `music21` can be configured to use it as an **external backend for converting the generated MusicXML score data into a high-quality PDF of drum sheet music**. When LilyPond encounters issues, `MuseScore` serves as a robust and visually capable alternative for rendering the final notation.

# Definitions


## `Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve` (`AUC`)

> ***Acoustics***
>
* **Meaning:** A common performance metric used to evaluate the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier. It quantifies how well a model can distinguish between positive and negative classes. The `AUC` score ranges from 0 to 1.0. For multi-label problems (where multiple categories can be present simultaneously, like in drum classification), `AUC` is typically calculated for each individual label (e.g., 'kick', 'snare') and then averaged (e.g., macro-average, micro-average) to provide an overall assessment of the model's discriminative power across all classes.
>
*  **Example:**
>   * An `AUC` of 1.0 indicates a perfect model that can perfectly distinguish between classes.
>    * An `AUC` of 0.5 suggests the model performs no better than random guessing.
>    * Higher `AUC` values (closer to 1.0) indicate better model performance.
>
## `Discrete Fourier Transform` (`DFT`) 
   > ***Mathematics***
  * **Meaning:** The **`Discrete Fourier Transform`** (or **`DFT`**) is a mathematical operation that **converts a sequence** of individual, distinct data points from their original *domain* (like time, or space) into a *frequency domain* representation. The `DFT` helps reveal the **underlying cycles** or periodic patterns present within that (discrete) data.   In short, the **`DFT`** breaks down the **complex temperature pattern** into its **repeating components**.
>
  * **Example:**
  > Imagine you have a discrete sequence of numbers, such daily temperature readings for a city over a year. **The **DFT** can analyse this data to tell you if there are dominant cycles**, such as a strong yearly temperature cycle, a weaker weekly cycle (e.g., *warmer weekends*), or even daily temperature fluctuations (if the data were more granular). 
  

<!--## `Fast Fourier Transform` (`FFT`)
  * **Meaning:** The **Fast Fourier Transform** (or `FFT`) is a clever and very quick way to break down a sound wave (or any complex signal) into its individual **component frequencies**. It tells you *which pitches are present* in a sound and *how loud they are*.
>
  * **Example:**
  > Imagine a chord played on a piano. The FFT takes that single, combined sound wave and reveals that it's made up of specific notes (frequencies) like C, E, and G, and how strong each of those notes is. It's like turning a mixed drink back into its separate ingredients.-->

## `Fast Fourier Transform` (`FFT`)
   > ***Mathematics***
  * **Meaning:** The **Fast Fourier Transform** (or *FFT*) is an efficient algorithm used to compute the **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**. In essence, it takes a sequence of numbers (discrete data points, like audio samples) and transforms them into a sequence of numbers that represent the different frequencies present in the original data, along with their magnitudes and phases.
>
  * **Example:**
  > Given a finite set of digital audio samples, the FFT quickly calculates the exact set of sine and cosine waves (each with a specific frequency and strength) that, when added together, perfectly reconstruct the original sequence of samples. This transformation is crucial for analyzing digital signals in frequency domain.-->


## `hop_length`
> ***Variable***
  * **Meaning:** How far the *listening window* (`n_fft`) slides forward (in number of samples) to take the next frequency snapshot.
>
  * **Example:** 
> If `hop_length=512`, the window (or `object_event`) moves **512 samples to the right** for the next analysis, overlapping with the previous window (`object_event`).

  * Playing around with the `hop_length` is often crucial for finding the right split of intervals in a given audio sample. 

## `n_fft`

> ***Variable***
  * **Meaning:** `n_fft` = **Number of Fast Fourier Transform** points. The size of the *listening window* (in number of samples) that is used to analyse the frequency content of an `audio_segment`.
>
  * **Example:** 
  > If **`n_fft= 2048`**, the analysis looks at **2048 samples** **at a time** to determine frequencies. If your `audio_segment` is **shorter than 2048 samples**, you get a warning.


## `sample_rate` (`sr`)
> ***Variable***
  * **Meaning:** How many *snapshots* of the sound wave are taken per second when audio is digitised. A higher number means more detail.
>
  * **Example:** 
  >
    > If **`sr = 22050 (Hz)`**, it means **`22,050`** sound measurements are recorded **every second**.
>
  * **Example:** 
>
    > If **`sr=22050 (Hz),`** and the **`input_signal`** of **one of your drum notes** is *`1744 milliseconds`* in length, then your **`sample_rate = ~38450 samples`**
